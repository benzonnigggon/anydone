                            <li>We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain
                                your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also
                                use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer
                                support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and
                                policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to
                                improve our websites and services.</li>

                            <li> We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In
                                most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service
                                you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have
                                another legal basis, such as our legitimate business
                                interests.</li>

                            <li>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information
                                in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your
                                browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not
                                work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies

                                a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like
                                developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must
                                have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using
                                your information, typically to serve you.</li>

                            <li> We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated

                        <p>If you handle other people's data using Anydone apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing. If you use a Anydone mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.</p>
                        <p>You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.</p>
                        <p>We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Anydone Services. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.</p>
                        <p>
                        If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data. To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.

                        <p>There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.</p>
                        <p>Third-party websites and social media widgets have their separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.</p>
                        <p>You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums. We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.</p>

                            <h6> Anydone’s Privacy Commitment</h6>
                            <p>Anydone has worried about customer and user privacy. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt-out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.</p>
                            <p>The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is, unfortunately, longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>
                            <h6 style="font-weight:700;">This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</h6><br>
                            <h6 style="padding-top:0px;">Part I – Information Anydone collects and controls</h6>
                            <p>This part deals with how Anydone collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Anydone's products and services, and others who contact Anydone through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.</p>
                            <h6>Part II – Information that Anydone processes on your behalf</h6>
                            <p>This part deals with how Anydone handles data that you entrust to Anydone when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.</p>
                            <h6>Part III – General</h6>
                            <p>This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Anydone's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.</p>

You'll also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing the created account. You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone, and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.</li>

Legal bases for collecting and using information
Legal processing bases applicable to Anydone: If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for information collection and use depends on the personal information concerned and the context in which we collect it. Most of our information collection and processing activities are typically based on (i) contractual necessity, (ii) one or more legitimate interests of Anydone or a third party that are not overridden by your data protection interests, or (iii) your consent. Sometimes, we may be legally required to collect your information or may need your personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
Withdrawal of consent: Where we rely on your consent as a legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Legitimate interests notice: Where we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis and those legitimate interests are not specified above, we will clearly explain to you what those legitimate interests are at the time that we collect your information.

Your choice in information use
Opt-out of non-essential electronic communications: You may opt-out of receiving newsletters and other non-essential messages by using the ‘unsubscribe’ function included in all such messages. However, you will continue to receive notices and essential transactional emails.
Disable cookies: You can disable browser cookies before visiting our websites. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use certain features of the websites properly.

These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
Domain registrars: When you register a domain through Anydone from domain name registrars, we share your name and contact information such as your physical address, email address and phone number with them as per the ICANN domain registration rules.

Your rights with respect to information we hold about you as a controller
If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights with respect to information that Anydone holds about you. Anydone undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.

Right to object: You have the right to object to the use of your information in certain circumstances, such as the use of your personal information for direct marketing.
Right to complain: You have the right to complain to the appropriate supervisory authority if you have any grievance against the way we collect, use or share your information. This right may not be available to you if there is no supervisory authority dealing with data protection in your country.

Retention of information
We retain your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
